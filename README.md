# About the project
Collab Note is a platform that aspires to create a space for all the students enrolled in a class to share resources with each other in order to have a complete pull of resources to support the class learning. 


# Major Requirements
- The user has an account that keeps information of the courses they are in
- The user can search for their class and join
- The user is able to share documents and images into this space for everyone to see
- The access to the spaces is restricted
- Friendly and intuitive UI

# Project Goals
- Offer a space where students of a class can share resources in one space removing the need of having to have friends/ know people on a class
- A space that will be useful to catch up on stuff you missed from a class if you missed it for any reason
