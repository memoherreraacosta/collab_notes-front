# About the project
Collab Note is a platform that aspires to create a space for all the students enrolled in a class to share resources with each other in order to have a complete pull of resources to support the class learning. 


# Major Requirements
- The user has an account that keeps information of the courses they are in
- The user can search for their class and join
- The user is able to share documents and images into this space for everyone to see
- The access to the spaces is restricted
- Friendly and intuitive UI

# Project Goals
- Offer a space where students of a class can share resources in one space removing the need of having to have friends/ know people on a class
- A space that will be useful to catch up on stuff you missed from a class if you missed it for any reason



# Sneak Peak
![](files/images/mockup_lab-web.png)


# Schedule
First partial:  
- Research and train React, Docker, Go with Gorilla, auth0, styled components, what database to use
- Mock up in paper of the site pages
- Define architecture
- Docker dockerfile
- Authentication using Auth0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Set up

- Create `.env` file and fill the content form the `.env.example` file.
- Create `src/auth_config.json` file and fill the content form the `src/auth_config.json.example` file.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
